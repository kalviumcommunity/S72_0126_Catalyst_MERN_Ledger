Backend: Only auth/login/signup, users (self info), and admin user management are implemented (route.ts, auth/login, api/users, api/admin). There are no project/task endpoints, no deduplication checks, and no logic that marks work as “already taken” or prevents duplicates. Middleware enforces JWT + admin RBAC (src/middleware.ts), but it only protects routes; it doesn’t implement any anti-duplication rules.
Frontend: The home page is a static mock showcasing the “stop duplication” story with sample projects/status chips (src/app/page.tsx), but it doesn’t call any real API, nor does it reflect live task/project state. No UI flows for claiming tasks, marking conflicts, or preventing duplicate entries.
Environment/run state: Frontend deps installed; backend/prisma install previously failed due to Node 22.11.0 (needs 22.12.0+). Even if Node is upgraded, current backend surface won’t deliver deduplication features.
Bottom line: The codebase does not currently implement the “stop duplication” logic beyond messaging. It lacks live project/task CRUD, duplicate detection, and UI to show/lock already-taken work.
